Re: how and what<br>

In my work, I investigate the images and symbols<br> that act as placeholders for real objects.<br><br>

[why should images and symbols be placeholders <br>for real objects/experiences? you don't have <br>to explain here though...]<br><br>

By compiling images, sounds, and landscapes from <br>the internet, I compress my lived experiences <br>into films and gifs.<br><br>

[true that, I removed a comma, + do you do more <br>than that? I think there is more...what if <br>you cannot find an external source that is suitable for what you want to show?]<br><br>

The process of image-experience compression <br>allows me to strip an experience down to its primitive forms, namely the specific colours, <br>sounds and symbols that are necessary to evoke the feeling of a place or object.<br><br>

[I merged these into one sentence]
